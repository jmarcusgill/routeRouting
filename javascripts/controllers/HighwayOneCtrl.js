As the only road connecting the Florida Keys, the 107-mile stretch of highway travels in-between islands, 'floating' above the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The route starts in Key Largo and ends in Key West, passing through world-class fishing sites, historic monuments, and state and national parks.";
