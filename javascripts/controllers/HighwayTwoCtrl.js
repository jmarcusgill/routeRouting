The Depression postponed its completion until 1938, when it became the first road to connect Chicago to Los Angeles via rural communities. Today, this primarily two-lane highway rarely appears on traditional maps, but drivers can still peek into its past and catch a nostalgic glimpseâ€”with well-preserved ticky-tacky tourist shops, attractions, and motels found alongside the road.";
